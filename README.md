# A guild to Multi-Threading vs. Multi-Processing & Process Synchronization

**Research paper on Multi-Threading vs. Multi-Processing** applies to Operating System & Application. The research analyzes the fundamental of multiprocess and multithreading programming. The report paper also explains the basics of how operating system functions, and OS Scheduler Algorithms. I also implement the Producer-Consumer Problem using Conditional Variables to explain issues in OS Scheduler. The research paper can be used as a good reference for multithreading Engineers, or embedded System Engineers when developing Multi-Threading and Multi-Processing applications.

The source code folder also include code example of Java Multithreading that was retrieved from Udemy course "Multi threading application development using Java". These source code provided solid foudation for Java application developer and can be applied  For more details please visit Udemy.com. Each folder exercise contain its own code and **Readme.md** file. Please refer to its for further details.

## Technology:
- Java
- Multithreading
- Data Structures
- Multi-Process
- Producer/Consumer Problems

## Getting Started
These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites
What things you need to install the software and how to install them

- Intellij: Deep intelligence: After IntelliJ IDEA has indexed your source code, it offers a blazing fast and intelligent experience by giving relevant suggestions in every context: instant and clever code completion, on-the-fly code analysis, and reliable refactoring tools. Out-of-the-box experience: Mission-critical tools such as integrated version control systems and a wide variety of supported languages and frameworks are all to hand — no plugin hassle included.
- Eclipse IDE: The Eclipse IDE is famous for our Java Integrated Development Environment (IDE), but we have several pretty cool IDEs, including our C/C++ IDE, JavaScript/TypeScript IDE, PHP IDE, and more. 
- Java Runtime Environment and Java Virtual Machine: Java software for your computer, or the Java Runtime Environment, is also referred to as the Java Runtime, Runtime Environment, Runtime, JRE, Java Virtual Machine, Virtual Machine, Java VM, JVM, VM, Java plug-in, Java plugin, Java add-on or Java download.

### Installing

A step by step series of examples that tell you how to get a development environment running.
Download and Install Java (Java Runtime Environment or Java Virtual Machine)
* [Java for Windows](https://java.com/en/download/) - we should download and install JVM before the Eclipse IDE 
Download and Install Eclipse IDE
* [Install Eclipse IDE](https://www.eclipse.org/ide/) - If you haven't downloaded and installed Eclipse IDE yet, here's how to get started.
* [Install Net Bean IDE](https://netbeans.org/features/index.html) - You can use either Eclipse IDE or Net Bean IDE, not need both. If you haven't downloaded and installed Eclipse IDE yet, here's how to get started.
* [Install Intellij](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/)

## To open the project using Intellij

1. File -> New -> "Project from Existing Sources" or "Import Project".
2. Select the project directory.
3. Select "Create Project from Existing Sources" and click "Next" repeatedly until the last window.
4. Click "Finish"

## Running the tests
Explain how to run the automated tests for this system:
- Start ConditionalVariable.java
- Tested complete successfully.

## Built With

* [Java Virtual Machine](https://java.com/en/download/)
* [Eclipse IDE for Windows](https://www.eclipse.org/ide/)
* [Install Intellij](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/)
